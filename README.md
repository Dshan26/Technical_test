This project is a brief example of an airplane game where we will tend to eliminate the enemy with shots, to start we will use object-oriented programming to give our project more functionality, we create 4 classes, the first is the main class, which is the class parent where we will call the child classes to execute said functionality, in this class we also give value to the property of the screen, the second class is our projectile class where with properties we give it the functionality and the size of the projectile in this case We give our projectile white color, in the third class it is our enemy class where we add an image with an image where we are going to give the value of enemies and values so that it is moving on the axis and, finally, we create our spaceship class which is very similar to the enemy class where we also add an image but this time we give values only on the positive and negative x-axis.
